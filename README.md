# Custom Boot Animation

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

This is a custom Boot animation using Plymouth and the two-step module

Many assets and settings from the official [Plymouth Repo](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/plymouth/plymouth) were used

Setup:
```bash
cd /usr/share/plymouth/themes
sudo git clone https://git.huber.cloud/moritz/custom-boot-animation moritz
sudo plymouth-set-default-theme moritz -R
```
